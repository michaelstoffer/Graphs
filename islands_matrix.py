NOTE TO SELF UPDATE DEFINITION

Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and returns the number of 1 islands. 
An island consists of 1s that are connected to the north, south, east or west, or a 1 by itself. 
For example:

islands = [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

islands[0][1]
islands[1][1]

1. Describe in graphs terminology
- What are our nodes? 1s
- When do we have an edge to another node? if one step away, to NSEW

What do we call a group of 1s/nodes? Connected components

2. Build your graph or define getNeighbors()

3. Choose your algorithm
